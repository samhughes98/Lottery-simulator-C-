# Lottery-simulator-C-
Program to simulate a lottery checker in C++

Program to compare lottery results to a lottery random number picker

I wanted to create a program that used multithreading to compute the result of a lottery simulation. I wanted to do this to see what performance indicators would show after multithreading had been implimented vs a normal sequential version of the program.

Creating the project was a very interesting and educationalundertaking as i have learnt a large amount about the c++ language and multithreading a program.

--created using VScode and gcc compiler--

To run just launch the .exe file provided *Make sure Lottery-numbers-csv is within the project folder*
